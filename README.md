# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction â€“ Machine Learning Classification Report

## ðŸ“Œ Project Title:
**Predicting Passenger Survival on the Titanic Using Machine Learning Algorithms**

---

## 1. Introduction

This project involves the development of a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster. The dataset used is a historical record from the Titanic tragedy, provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data), and contains information about passengers such as their age, sex, class, fare, and family relationships aboard the ship.

The goal is to build a predictive classification model that accurately determines the survival status of passengers using these features.

## 2. Problem Statement

The aim of this classification task is to predict the survival status of Titanic passengers (`1 = Survived`, `0 = Did not survive`) using the available dataset. By analyzing various demographic and travel-related features, the model seeks to uncover patterns associated with survival outcomes.

## 3. Dataset Overview

- **Source:** Titanic dataset from Kaggle  
- **Number of rows:** 891  
- **Number of columns:** 12  

### Key Features:
- `Pclass` (Passenger class)  
- `Sex`  
- `Age`  
- `SibSp` (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)  
- `Parch` (Number of parents/children aboard)  
- `Fare`  
- `Embarked` (Port of embarkation)  
- `Cabin`  
- `Ticket`

### Feature Engineering:
- **Deck:** Extracted from the `Cabin` column (first letter)  
- **Ticket_Number:** Numeric part extracted from the `Ticket` field

## 4. Methodology

### a. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values appropriately  
- Converted categorical variables using encoding  
- Engineered new features such as `Deck` and `Ticket_Number`  

### b. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed feature distributions  
- Explored relationships with survival outcome  
- Visualized patterns using seaborn and matplotlib  

### c. Model Building
Applied multiple supervised learning algorithms:
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  

### d. Model Evaluation
Evaluated models using:
- Accuracy  
- Confusion Matrix  
- ROC-AUC Score

## 5. Results

Each modelâ€™s performance was compared. The model with the best overall evaluation metrics (especially AUC) was selected and interpreted. Insights from feature importance and model performance are discussed in the notebook.
